# Models

These are the Sequelize models that make up the 'M' part of 'ORM'. These models are primarily used for their data structures and configuring Sequelize, not really for storing much business logic. That mostly has to do with the fact that the Backend doesn't have a whole heck of a lot of tangible business logic; since everything is encrypted from the POV of the Backend, it can't do much. As such, almost all of the model-like business logic is in the Frontend.
