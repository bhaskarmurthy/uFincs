# Email Templates

These email templates are primarily used for auth-related emails (email change, password reset, etc). The HTML templates are based on some provided by Mailgun, obviously customized for uFincs' styles.

Since they're just HTML files, you can open them directly in a browser for development. The logo won't show up (since it's provided as an encoded file during email creation), but they should otherwise just work.
