# Scripts

Just like the rest of the repo, these are just some useful utility scripts for the Frontend.

```
├── capBuildProd.sh                     # Helper script for building the Frontend static assets for Capacitor using the appropriate prod env vars.
├── cypress_run_parallel_single.sh      # Main script for the parallel Cypress process; runs a single instance.
├── forwardPortsToAndroidEmulator.sh    # Helper script for forwarding local ports to Android emulator for Android Capacitor testing.
├── run.sh                              # Main script used by the Frontend Docker image for running either dev or prod.
└── split_spec_files.js                 # Helper script for the parallel Cypress process; performs the splitting on the test suite files.
```
