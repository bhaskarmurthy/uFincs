# Electron App

This is the code for the Electron (desktop) version of the Capacitor app for uFincs. The vast majority of the code in here is either generated by Capacitor or copied in during the build process. Which is to say, unless you need to make very specific modifications to the Electron app, you probably don't need to touch anything in here. Since this is an Electron app, it should work on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Instructions for building and running the Electron app (and other Capacitor apps) can be found in the [README](../README.md) for the Frontend service.
