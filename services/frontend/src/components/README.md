# Components

The heart and soul of uFincs' UI: it's atomic design component system. If you're not familiar with atomic design, [start here](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).

Basically, we have the smallest components as 'atoms'. Those atoms are used to build 'molecule' components. Then atoms and molecules are then combined to make 'organisms'. We technically eschew the 'template' or 'page' concepts in favour of 'scenes' (which are are essentially pages but more generic).

Which is really just to say: this is just an arbitrary system for organizing components that I've grown quite fond of. I have found that uFincs' component hierarchy has definitely outgrown using 'just' atoms/molecules/organisms (based on just the sheer number of components of each type), but the beauty is that applying further organiziation (perhaps by type or feature area) wouldn't be difficult (I just haven't bothered).

Oh yeah, then there's 'charts'. That's... just me not wanting to put them under 'organisms' even though they probably should. Like I said, more organization needed.
