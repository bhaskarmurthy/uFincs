# App Assets

These are all of the assets (fonts, graphics, icons, etc) that are used within the app itself. Anything that needs to be publicly accessed should instead be placed in the top-level `public` folder.

Fonts: We self-host all of the fonts we need (rather than relying on Google Fonts). Currently, the one and only font we use is Nunito.
Graphics: Might as well be named 'images'. Except I kind of think of 'graphics' as 'images but svg'. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Icons: We keep all of our icons as SVG files and then consume them as React components.
