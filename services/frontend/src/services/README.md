# Services

Services are core pieces of business logic that exist separately from React components or Redux. They may or may not make use of Models.

DateService is probably the most noteworthy service since dates play such a big role in uFincs. However, it's also one of the more jank aspects; definitely regret doing all of the date manipulations myself.
