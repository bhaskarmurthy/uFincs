# Scenes

'Scenes' are the final piece of uFincs' atomic design system, replacing the 'pages' concept in the original system. For our uses, scenes are basically just the biggest components â€” ones that would take up most of a user's attention at any one point in time. As such, scenes _encompass_ pages while also including things like large forms.
