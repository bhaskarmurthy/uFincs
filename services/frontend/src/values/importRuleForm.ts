    // 1. It is likely that it will be the more commonly used property.
    // 2. There is an annoying bug with using the Account property as the default for the action
    //    where, since the value is blank by default, the `SelectInput` will also be blank even
    //    though a valid `defaultValue` has been given to it. Yet this behaviour doesn't show up
    //    when creating other actions with the Account property â€” it's literally only the first one.

    // I think the bug in 2. could be fixed by passing in the accounts to the ImportRuleForm
    // so that they can get here and we can assign an actual default account value, but that's
    // much more work than just changing the default to Description.
