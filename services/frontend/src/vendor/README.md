# Vendored Packages

This is just any open-source code that I decided was easy to keep in the codebase, for one reason or another. Which... technically only applies to the `stopword` package, since I just wanted the list of stopwords.

`redux-e2e-encryption` is actually _my own_ code that I had intended to eventually turn into a package. Haven't got around to it yet, but keeping the code here leaves it as a reminder.
