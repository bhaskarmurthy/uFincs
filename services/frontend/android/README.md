# Android App

This is the code for the Android version of the Capacitor app for uFincs. The vast majority of the code in here is either generated by Capacitor or copied in during the build process. Which is to say, unless you need to make very specific modifications to the Android app, you probably don't need to touch anything in here.

Instructions for building and running the Android app (and other Capacitor apps) can be found in the [README](../README.md) for the Frontend service.
