# Public Assets

These are the static assets that are served on a consistent public URL. The only things in here are things like the usuals `favicon.ico` or `index.html` as well as all of the files required for `manifest.json`.

All assets used by the app itself (i.e. imported into code or CSS) should instead be placed in `src/assets`.
