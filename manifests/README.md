# Kubernetes Manifests

These are the **generated** and **static** manifests needed for deploying uFincs to a Kubernetes cluster.

The **static** manifests are just that: they are manifests that are kept as git-tracked files that fairly rarely change.

The **generated** manifests are those that are generated by Kubails using the Helm templates in the `helm` folder. Since these change from deployment to deployment, they are not kept in the repo. Manifests can be generated using:

```
kubails cluster manifests generate
```

However, this isn't something you'd be doing a regular basis, since the Cloud Build pipeline handles this. Of course, if you're doing something like deploying to a custom Kubernetes cluster, your circumstances will be different.
